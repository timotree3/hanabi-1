"""Low-level classes for tracking state of a Hanabi round.

Intended to be imported by a higher-level game manager (play_hanabi).  The meat
of this file is the Round class, which stores all of the game info, along with
the nested Hand class, which stores player-specific info.

Common attributes/arguments:
  card (dict): Representation of a card.  Includes when the card was drawn and
    all associated hint info.  See Hand class for details.
  names (list of str): How players are identified in printed output.
